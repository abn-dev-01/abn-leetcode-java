An integer is a **palindrome** when it reads the same backward as forward.
For example, `121` is palindrome while `123` is not.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 121  
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = -121  
Output: false  
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
